# Blog Section Documentation

## Overview

The blog section is a Next.js-based implementation that provides a modern, responsive blog experience for the website. It uses a file-based approach for storing blog posts in Markdown format and implements various React components for displaying the content.

## Architecture

The blog system follows a clean architecture with the following key components:

1. **Data Layer**: Blog posts are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter for metadata.
2. **API Layer**: Functions to read, parse, and manipulate blog post data.
3. **UI Components**: React components for rendering different parts of the blog UI.
4. **Pages**: Next.js pages for routing and rendering blog list and single post views.

## File Descriptions

### Main Pages

#### `page.tsx`

The main blog listing page that:
- Fetches all blog posts
- Displays a featured post in a hero section
- Shows a sidebar with categories
- Lists all blog posts in a grid layout

#### `[slug]/page.tsx`

A dynamic route page that:
- Gets a specific blog post based on the slug parameter
- Generates metadata for SEO
- Renders the full blog post with title, cover image, and content
- Displays author information and publishing date
- Shows related posts and navigation

### API

#### `api/posts.ts`

Contains functions for working with blog posts:
- `getAllPosts()`: Retrieves all blog posts from the file system
- `getPostBySlug(slug)`: Gets a specific post by its slug
- `getPostsByCategory(category)`: Filters posts by category
- `getFeaturedPosts()`: Gets posts marked as featured
- `getPostsByTag(tag)`: Filters posts by tag
- `calculateReadingTime(content)`: Helper function to estimate reading time

### Components

#### `components/BlogHero.tsx`

A hero component that displays a featured post prominently at the top of the blog page.

#### `components/BlogList.tsx`

Renders a list/grid of blog posts, each represented by a BlogCard component.

#### `components/BlogCard.tsx`

Card component that displays a preview of a blog post with:
- Cover image
- Title
- Excerpt
- Publication date
- Reading time
- Author info

#### `components/BlogCategories.tsx`

Sidebar component that lists all blog categories for navigation.

#### `components/BlogPost.tsx`

Component for rendering a full blog post with all its content and metadata.

### Data

#### `data/categories.ts`

Defines the blog categories with their IDs, names, slugs, and descriptions.

#### `data/posts/*.md`

Markdown files for each blog post with YAML frontmatter containing:
- Title
- Excerpt
- Publication date
- Author
- Category
- Tags
- Cover image path
- Featured status

Example frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: 'Getting Started with Next.js'
excerpt: 'Learn the basics of Next.js and how to build your first application'
date: '2023-06-15'
author: 'John Doe'
category: 'development'
tags: ['nextjs', 'react', 'tutorial']
coverImage: '/images/blog/nextjs-cover.jpg'
---
```

### Utils

#### `utils/types.ts`

TypeScript type definitions for the blog:
- `BlogCategory`: Defines the structure of a blog category
- `BlogAuthor`: Defines the structure of a blog post author
- `BlogPost`: Defines the structure of a blog post with all its metadata and content

## How It Works

### Post Rendering Flow

1. When a user visits the main blog page:
   - `page.tsx` calls `getAllPosts()` to fetch all blog posts
   - Blog posts are sorted by date (newest first)
   - A featured post is identified and displayed in the hero section
   - All posts are listed in the main content area

2. When a user visits an individual blog post:
   - `[slug]/page.tsx` calls `getPostBySlug(slug)` to fetch the specific post
   - The post content is rendered using ReactMarkdown for proper formatting
   - Metadata is generated for SEO purposes

### Data Management

Blog posts are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. The `posts.ts` API functions:
1. Read the Markdown files from the file system
2. Parse the frontmatter using gray-matter
3. Extract and organize the content and metadata
4. Return structured BlogPost objects

### Styling and UI

The blog section uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with a responsive design that works well on all device sizes. The layout follows best practices:
- Clean, readable typography
- Responsive grid layout
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- Accessible color contrast

## Extending the Blog

### Adding New Posts

To add a new blog post:
1. Create a new Markdown file in `data/posts/`
2. Add the required frontmatter metadata at the top of the file
3. Write the post content in Markdown format
4. The post will automatically appear in the blog listing

### Creating New Components

To extend the UI:
1. Create new React components in the `components/` directory
2. Import and use them in the relevant page components
3. Follow the existing patterns for props and styling

### Adding Custom Functionality

To add new features:
1. Extend the API functions in `posts.ts` as needed
2. Update TypeScript types in `types.ts` if required
3. Create new components to display the new functionality
4. Modify page components to use the new features

## Conclusion

The blog section provides a flexible, maintainable system for managing and displaying blog content. Its file-based approach makes it easy to add new content while the component-based UI allows for customization and extension as needed.
